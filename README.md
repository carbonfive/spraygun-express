# app-prototype

This is an NodeJS Express app that publishes a JSON API.

## Prerequisites

- Node 8.11.3
- Yarn 1.7.0

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Start the server:

```
yarn dev
```

Verify it is working by making an HTTP request:

<http://localhost:5000/api/hello>

## Task reference

- **`yarn dev`** starts the Express server listing on port 5000. The server is automatically restarted whenever you make changes.
- **`yarn test`** runs tests in "watch" mode, automatically focusing on tests or code that were modified since the last commit. Press the `a` key after the test runner has started to watch all tests in the project.
- **`yarn test:coverage`** runs all tests, prints coverage stats, and then exits.
- **`yarn lint`** runs all ESLint checks and then exits.
- **`yarn start`** starts the Express server on port 5000 (or `$PORT`, if specified). This task is intended for running the app in deployment in conjunction with `NODE_ENV=PRODUCTION`.
